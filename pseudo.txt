OKOKOK :O I can't focus its 4pm on a friday, after a long week....

ok

so I get the pdf path
load a pddoc
I get the pages
I scan off their code
	that require me to:
	pull the png
	crop properly
	and scan
I put the the codes into a linked list (same length as pages)


OK now I have all the codes and all the pages
I take the unique from the codes
I make a new doc for each unique
I itterate throught the codes and add their corresponding page to the approprite doc
I save the docs (in the appropriate file)

done and done

so what methods do I need

abstract page
	String scan()
		crop!
		return scan
	abstract crop

orgo ( path, dir ) 
	pages = load(path).pages
	cast all pages to abstract page
	codes = pages.scans.uniq
	for each c in codes
		doc = new pddoc
		for each p in pages
			if(p.scan==c) doc.add(p)
		doc.save(named c) {{=> a directory listener will then file it away...?}}
